This guide follow the atomic design pattern for building component.
Atomic design is a methodology for creating design system. It divide the design in 5 levers:
* Atoms
* Molecules
* Organisms
* Templates
* Pages


#### Atoms
Atoms are the most basic building blocks for web interfaces.
Atoms are html tag such as a form, label, an input or a button.

#### Molecules
Molecules are a group of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units
of a compuond. In web design this means molecules are group of
tags combined together to form something useful.
An example of this is a **search form**.  One characteristic of this aproach as Brad frost
mention is that building up to molecules from atoms encourages a "do one thing and do it well'

> Building up to molecules from atoms encourages a 'do one thing and do it well'
